## Bio
I have worked in the scientific Python ecosystem as an environmental researcher, an open source contributor, and on both the frontend and backend data science platform product teams. I am passionate about finding creative ways to enhance understanding of the physical world. In my current role as Head of Open Source at Saturn Cloud I help maintain Dask and contribute to product management and engineering. Before joining Saturn I worked on the HoloViz team at Anaconda and as a hydrometeorology researcher at Princeton University.
