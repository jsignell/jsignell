## Bio
I have worked in the scientific Python ecosystem as an environmental researcher, an open source contributor, and a web developer.
I am passionate about finding creative ways to enhance understanding of the physical world.
My past experience includes maintaining Dask (open source distributed computing tool) and
HoloViz (open source high-level visualization tool) and
contributing to product management and engineering on data science platform product teams.
In my current role at Element 84 (formerly Azavea), I work on the Civic Applications team maintaining django/react web 
applications and on the Geospatial Research and Technology team developing open source best practices for scientists.
